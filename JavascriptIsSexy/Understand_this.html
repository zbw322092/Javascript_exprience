    var person = {
      firstName: 'Bowen',
      lastName: 'Zhong',
      // 下面的fullName method中定义了this，这里的this将指向person这个object，因为person这个object会调用fullName这个method。
      fullName: function() {

    // all functions in JavaScript have properties, just as objects have properties. And when a function executes, it gets the this property—a variable with the value of the object that invokes the function where this is used
    // The this reference ALWAYS refers to (and holds the value of) an object
    // this is used inside a function (let’s say function A) and it contains the value of the object that invokes function A. We need this to access methods and properties of the object that invokes function A, especially since we don’t always know the name of the invoking object, and sometimes there is no name to use to refer to the invoking object.
    

    // If you understand this one principle of JavaScript’s this, you will understand the “this” keyword with clarity: this is not assigned a value until an object invokes the function where this is defined. 
    // Even though it appears this refers to the object where it is defined, it is not until an object invokes the this Function that this is actually assigned a value. And the value it is assigned is based exclusively on the object that invokes the this Function.

    person.fullName();

    var anotherPerson = {
      firstName: 'Hui',
      lastName: 'Liu'
    };

    person.fullName.apply(anotherPerson);



    // Fix this when used in a method passed as a callback
    // 通过bind(), apply(), call()等方法来指定this的context


    // Fix this inside closure
    // It is important to take note that closures cannot access the outer function’s this variable by using the this keyword because the this variable is accessible only by the function itself, not by inner functions.
    // this inside the anonymous function cannot access the outer function’s this, so it is bound to the global window object

    var user3 = {

      },
      printText: function() {
        console.log(this.data.firstName + ' is ' + this.data.age + ' years old');
      }
    };

    user3.printText(); // Bowen is 24 years old

    var man = user3.printText;
    man(); // kid is 6 years old

    // 解决方案也是使用bind()方法
    var man2 = user3.printText.bind(user3);
    man2(); // Bowen is 24 years old
