    // We use the Bind () method primarily to call a function with the this value set explicitly. It other words, bind () allows us to easily set which specific object will be bound to this when a function or method is invoked.
    // The need for bind usually occurs when we use the this keyword in a method and we call that method from a receiver object; 
    
    // Javascript's bind allows us to set the this value on methods
